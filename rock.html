                <h2>What is rock music?</h2>
                    <p>Based on information from britannica.com, rock is a form of music with a strong beat. There is not real definition for rock since it has many different styles.
                        They also categorize rock as a type of beat that involves electric guitar, bass, organ or piano. Lastly, rock also uses forms of blues music which gives it a unique beat.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>How did rock become popular?</h2>
                    <p>Rock emerged as a popular genre in the 1950s and continued to spread to europe in the 1960s and eventually all over the world by the 1990s. Its loud beats and uplifting tones would get people to "rock out" and party.
                        Some of the most popular names in early rock and roll was Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan. These names paved the way for rock music and created its global popularity.
                    </p>

                <h2>What is the future for rock music?</h2>
                    <p>The rock genre has become less popular over the years but that could be due to the change in the younger generation. In the past, rock was an outlet for rebellion and to stand your ground. Today those values have started to slowly change.
                        With that being said, rock does continue to evolve by adding pop and electornics to its traditional instramentals. Bands such as Falling In Reverse, Bad Omens, Sleep Token and Bring Me The Horizon have all implamented electronic beats to their music.
                        This has become so popular that it has kept rock alive even with the younger generation. I don't think rock music will ever disappear, it will just continue to evolve by creating new forms of music within its genre.
                    </p>
