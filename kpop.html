                <h2>What is K-pop?</h2>
                    <p>Based on Los Angeles Film School, k-pop or Korean Pop is an internationally popular, aethetic-driven, style-bending and trendsetting music genre of the 21st centry.
                        K-pop was created in Korea and blends many different styles of music together to create an exciting and visually appealing experience. It has created many popular groups such as BLACKPINK, Girls Generation and BTS.
                        Most of the time, K-pop is done in korean but there are many songs that have english and other languages sprinkled in to create a dynamic feel to the music.
                    </p>
                
                <h2>How did K-pop become popular?</h2>
                    <p>It started back in the 1950s with a group called The Kim Sisters. There was only three of them and they would sing American pop songs in korean to GI's during the Korean War.
                        Heading into the 1970s, a singer and composer Kim Min-Ki would sing one of his famous songs "Morning Dew". This song was aimed at the youth pro-democracy and became a political song to push activism.
                        In the 1990s, a group called Seo Taiji and Boys boosted the popularity of kpop with hip-hop choreography and unique musical sounds. As k-pop began to grow within Korea and the United States, it started to take off quickly in the early 2000s.
                        Currently, K-pop is one of the hottest genres of music and groups involved in it tend to sit at the top of many music charts. Groups like EXO, BTS, BLACKPINK, NewJeans and so many more have continued to evolve K-pop globally.  
                    </p>

                <h2>Are there other cultures that try to create K-pop in their own way?</h2>
                    <p>Yes, K-pop has become so popular that there are many groups today that are not purely Korean but create a Pop feeling to their music. Groups like Black Swan introduced the first Senalgalese member who was not Korean at all as a K-pop idol.
                        There is also EXP Edition which is an all boy group that is purely from America but they create K-pop styled music. Another group called Kaachi was the first European-based K-pop group that formed in 2020 outside of South Korea.
                        So to say that K-pop is only korean is false, it has a mix of many different cultures and backgrounds that have created amazing groups making exciting music. The fact that K-pop has branched out to different cultures but has held its core values, just shows how popular the genre has become wordwide.
