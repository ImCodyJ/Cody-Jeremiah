                    <h2>What is R&B?</h2>
                    <p>The acronym R&B stands for Rhythm and Blues which is a term used for several types of post-war African-American popular music. The "Rhythm & Blues" term was created
                        to replace the designation "race music". The "Rhythm" part comes from the music using a four-beat measurer or bars and the liberal use of a backbeat. The "Blues" part
                        comes from the lyrics and melodies of the song which were usually sad, especially around the World War II era. The name was changed to R&B over time as a matter of
                        convenience.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2> How did R&B become popular?</h2>
                    <p>R&B is a popular genre that started in African-American communities in the 1940s. RCA victor was marketing black music under the name "Blues and Rhythm" in 1948. The blooming 
                        of R&B had cross roads with the social issue of segregation in the American society. Many advocates of segregation wrongly claimed that R&B and Rock and roll were 
                        "dangerous to American youth". The youth continued to listen to these genres which led to the forming of bonds that transcened cultural backgrounds and skin color.
                    </p>
                   
                    <h2>What is the current state of R&B?</h2>
                    <p>Other forms of R&B has formed overtime with many sub genres like Funk, Disco, Dance, and many more. R&B music is still around and has infiltrated the mainstream and became
                        the sound of pop. This is great but causes some people to say its dead because of it being mislabeled by record labels. Record labels don't priotize the genre as much
                        as they would a decade ago. No matter what they're still artist like The Weekend, Daniel Caesar, and SZA who still prosper in the genre.
