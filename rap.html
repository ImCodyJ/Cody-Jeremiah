                    <h2>What is rap music?</h2>
                    <p>Rap music is a genre that originated in the 1970s. Rap is characterized by different types of spoken poetry, ryhme, and rhythm that is done over a beat. Rap artist typically use 
                        slang and metaphoric language to express issues in the world. Another word for rap would be hip-hop, where another word for rappers would be MCs (Microphone Controllers). You don't 
                        need to be melodically gifted to be an rapper, your natural voice and good or catchy lyrics is all you need.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2> How did rap become popular?</h2>
                    <p>Rap music began to pick up steam in New York City around the 1970s. It began as a collaborative effort among Black, Latino, and Caribbean American youth at block parties. These block parties 
                        featured a mix of soul and funk songs that were spun on turntables by DJs. The songs would fascinate an audience where people would clap along and dance to the rhythm. DJs had began to try
                        new techniques during these parties and once they became mainstream, those that we call rappers now, would start applying them to their songs. By the late 1970s. rap had become very
                        popular through out the entire world.
                    </p>
                   
                    <h2>What is the future for rap?</h2>
                    <p>Rap is widespread all over the globe with everyone putting there own spin to it. Rap collaborations with almost every genre of music are very successful. Rap has
                        grown commercially to fit a more diverse audience. Todays rap is very popular with teens and young adults with artist like Drake, NBA YoungBoy, and Lil baby being the 
                        forefront. The sound has changed alot where you will hear more singing than you would use to. New subgenres evolve everyday so its hard to tell what the next big 
                        wave would be.
